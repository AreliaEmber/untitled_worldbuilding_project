Galaxy is a relatively standard elliptical galaxy, with the inner areas of the galaxy being more active and dangerous than the equivalent regions of the milky way due to the presence of [[Magicules]]. Within the galactic habitable zone the environment is much more standard with a relatively low [[Magicules|Magicule]] density within the solar systems, and nearly none in the ambient space outside of the sphere of influence of any particular star. This leads to a galactic habitable zone that is more or less the same as that of the milky way on an interstellar scale.
