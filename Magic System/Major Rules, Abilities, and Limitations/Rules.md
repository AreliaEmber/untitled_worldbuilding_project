Main questions:

What is it called?
- (Insert name of magic system here whenever I think of one)
What level of magic is it?
- Medium-High: Kingdoms rise and fall at the whims of magic, but the world generally cannot be destroyed by it, and only in rare cases are major geographic features altered by magic
Learned, inherent, or inherent-learned?
- Learned. Sort of. Most spontaneous magic should be learned, but in rare cases there can be instinctive casting, and in very rare extremes this instinctive casting can go beyond what is understood by traditional magicians of the relevant era
How common is the inherent variant?
- extremely uncommon. Max 5 per era, usually 1 or 2 per era. Because these individuals are usually more powerful than others, they often survive across era boundaries and therefore can inflate the number that are present at any given time, but
