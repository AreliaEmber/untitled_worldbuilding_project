Main questions:

What is it called?
- (Insert name of magic system here whenever I think of one)
What level of magic is it?
- Medium-High: Kingdoms rise and fall at the whims of magic, but the world generally cannot be destroyed by it, and only in rare cases are major geographic features altered by magic
Learned, inherent, or inherent-learned?
- Learned. Sort of. Most spontaneous magic should be learned, but in rare cases there can be instinctive casting, and in very rare extremes this instinctive casting can go beyond what is understood by traditional magicians of the relevant era
How common is the inherent variant?
- extremely uncommon. Max 5 per era, usually 1 or 2 per era. Because these individuals are usually more powerful than others, they often survive across era boundaries and therefore can inflate the number that are present at any given time, but if many die then it will take a long time for more to be born.
What actuates the effect?
- Magic is an inherent fundamental force in this world, similar to nuclear or electromagnetic forces. It's a more wild force, not simply stemming from a single point carrier, but being able to execute force in more complex ways. Activating this force requires mana, which is fundamentally present in all matter and regenerates over time, but at a limited rate, causing *seemingly* unpredictable results where a lack of mana in an area can cause magic to not function at all, while an overabundance of mana can cause wild and powerful effects that normally wouldn't happen. Mana is carried by subatomic particles called [[Magicules]]. 
Notes about mana?
- mana cannot be seen, it's essentially the charge of [[Magicules]], and can be extracted using [[Runes]] or via a (usually) learned feeling (see [[Learned Magic]]), often accompanied by a chant although not strictly necessary.
Is magic limited or unlimited?
- Limited. See [[Possible effects of magic]] for more explanation.
Does it require a reagent?
- for written and ritual magics, yes. The reagent would be a material with a high density of [[Magicules]]. In spontaneous magic, a reagent can be used to allow for more powerful effects, but the mana within the human body can also be used as a reagent.
How common is magic in this society?
- until [[The Age of Magic]] not very, but the incident that kickstarts that age is the discovery of how to make [[Runes]], which allows a whole new, more widely available kind of magic to take root.
Users tend to be?
- for spontaneous magic users are almost always highly educated, as are the creators of magic objects that use [[Runes]] and the practitioners of ritual magic using [[Magic Circles]]. The end user of a magic object could be anyone that is able to get their hands on a completed artefact.
What are the social implications of magic?
- See [[Societal implications of magic]]
What are the limits?
- see [[Strict limitations]]
