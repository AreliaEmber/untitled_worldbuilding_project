I pulled at my braids nervously, trying desperately not to think too hard about what was to come. My finger got caught on one of the many pins holding my intricate hairdo in place, and I braced myself for the scolding that was to come.

"[[Erica]] darling, you simply must sit still, we don't have time to redo everything if you pull something loose".

I felt the firm grip of my head maid [[Penelope]]'s hands as she expertly extracted my fingers without even a hair landing out of place. I exhaled, finally releasing the breath that I hadn't even realised I was holding. It seemed that she was in a good mood today, since she didn't even really scold me. I suppose she would be, considering she was about to be rid of me after all these years.

"Now darling, all you have to do is follow along with the directions of the [[Priest]] and try not to hurt anyone with that nasty... *affliction* of yours".

I nodded, glancing over at [[Penelope]]'s eyes in the mirror as she gave me a stern look. The disgust in the way she had emphasised 'affliction' was so thick I almost felt like I could touch it. I took a deep breath and tried to calm the inner turmoil a little, even though I knew it was futile. The look my eyes had in the mirror in front of me resembled the look a deer gave to a hunter the moment it realised that it wasn't going to get away.

[[Penelope]] grabbed me by the shoulders and pulled me up a little, which I took as an indication that it was time to stand. I shut my eyes as tight as I could as she led me by the shoulders to where I would have to wait the last few minutes. I tried to take courage from the last few moments of peace as I simply pretended that this day hadn't yet come. Of course, when I opened my eyes, I would surely be in the library or the garden, just as with any other day. So I told myself, yet reality could not be so pleasant.

I took one last deep breath as we finally came to a stop and I realised that it was going to be time soon, and I slowly opened my eyes. I was greeted by the massive double doors of the main royal [[Church]], and an assortment of several maids waiting outside. The doors were still closed, and knowing what lay beyond them I truly wished that they could just stay that way. One of the maids rushed over to me and held out a bouquet of flowers for me grab. As I reached for them though, a sense of dread washed over me as I felt a familiar surge.

Just before our hands would have touched, a thin, glowing blue strand of energy leapt from my fingers to the maid's, producing a loud *pop* sound as it connected. The maid went stiff for a moment, before collapsing onto the ground in a heap. I instinctively withdrew my hand, clutching it to my chest as I stared at the fallen maid in horror.

"I... I'm so sorry, really" I started, trying hard to keep myself from crying as all of the emotions rushed to the surface.

"really I... I didn't mean to..."

"Move aside, make room" [[Penelope]] barked, ordering the maids aside as they had simply been staring in shock.

"What's done is done, darling, now would you simply pick up the bouquet and I'll have this one taken to the infirmary".

That's when I knew for sure that she was in a good mood. Normally she would've been furious at any display of my curse, and yet she simply brushed it off today even though someone got hurt. I tried to breath slowly and deeply to calm myself as I bent down and reached towards the bouquet on the ground. I could see the maids collectively flinch as my hand neared the limp fingers of the collapsed maid, and I couldn't blame them. I'd be scared of me too.

I managed to retrieve the bouquet without incident and stepped aside for [[Penelope]] to lift the maid and pull her away. I saw her eyes just barely starting to flutter back open as two others took her in their arms and carried her away. Just they rounded a corner and escaped from view, the [[Church]] doors opened just wide enough for a servant to whisper through them that they were ready for us.

At that, [[Penelope]] glided over in front of me and began adjusting my necklaces and some of the finer details of my dress. She took a deep breath and locked eyes with me. Her brown eyes had a look in them I had never seen before. Happiness? Glee? Maybe even pride? I wasn't entirely sure.

"Now is the moment of truth, princess". [[Penelope]] wore a stern, neutral expression that betrayed little of what she was really thinking as she spoke. "Go in there and make us proud".

What an odd choice of words. 'Make us proud'. As if I could ever do something that one could be proud of, least of all [[Penelope]]. My brain lagged for a moment as I tried to process that statement, and before I had a chance to brace myself, the doors ahead of me had already swung open. I could feel the gazes of everyone in the room ahead pointed back towards me expectantly as I briefly considered trying to run away, although I abandoned the idea as quickly as I had it.

I focused on putting one foot in front of the other and began striding down the centre of the [[Church]], clutching the bouquet with both hands as if it were the only thing keeping me alive. I saw my betrothed [[Damien]] waiting expectantly at the altar with the [[Priest]]. He was dressed up very nicely today, with his short brown hair brushed back and a massive smile on his handsome face. I just wished I could share his obvious joy at the events that were to come.

When I arrived at the altar, the ceremony began, and it all went by in a blur of words and stares. I did my best to simply hold [[Damien]]'s gaze the entire time and let my subconscious autopilot through my parts of the ceremony. I had rehearsed it so many times already that I was pretty sure I could do this part in my sleep. It was what happened as soon as the ceremony was over that I was truly dreading.

"You may kiss the bride!" the [[Priest]] announced with gusto, causing [[Damien]] to take my gloved hands and lean in for a kiss. I reluctantly obliged, trying my best to keep my emotions stable and not let the curse out. Somehow I made it through the kiss without hurting him, and the ceremony came to a close with applause from the audience. Now came the main party, and then... well, I'd rather not think so far ahead.

Unfortunately for me, in my looming dread the afterparty also seemed to fly by, and I soon found myself being lead down the hall by [[Damien]], my gloved hand being pulled along by his. It was time to consummate the marriage. He lead me into my bedroom - or well, our bedroom now, I suppose - and shut the door behind us. He reached out to stroke my cheek with his hand, and I recoiled away from him. 

"I'm not scared of your 'curse', princess" he said with commitment, locking eyes with me. 

"That's what I'm afraid of".

He chuckled.

"I'm strong, you don't need to worry about me" he reassured, "even if you do lose control, I'll be fine".

I wasn't nearly as sure as he was, but he seemed determined to go through with this anyway. I took a deep breath to steel my nerves and nodded weakly.

"okay" I whispered.

He smiled widely at that and discarded his gloves. He helped me remove my jewellery and unlace the back of my dress, and in the process removed removed his own suit until we were both standing in front of the bed in only our undergarments.

"Trust me princess" he whispered into my ear as his hand brushed along my arm, "everything will be just fine".

With that, he removed my undershirt and tenderly pulled me into a hug, our bare chests pressed against each other. I felt relieved as nothing happened for a moment, and I relaxed a little as I looked up into his eyes. Luck was not on my side however, as a sudden sense of dread overwhelmed me. I didn't have time to even say anything before the surge ran through me, and [[Damien]] spasmed violently. I screamed, and his body fell limp onto the bed beside me.

I quickly grabbed my undershirt, and pulled it over my head as I ran to the door. I pulled it open and screamed for help, hoping someone was nearby, before rushing back and picking up my gloves. After I had pulled them on, I gingerly flipped [[Damien]]'s limp body over so that I could see his front. His entire chest was red, and the hair seemed to be singed. More importantly, he didn't seem to be breathing.
