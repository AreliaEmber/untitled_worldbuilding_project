Preceded by [[The Age of Heroes]]
Followed by [[The Age of Teleportation]]

The age of monuments began in 768 AR following the death of the last hero and the subsequent end of [[The Age of Heroes]]. This is unique in that the beginning of the age is marked not by an event of this age, but of the age before it. The age of monuments ended with the invention of stable [[Teleportation Gates]] in 933 AR and the subsequent beginning of [[The Age of Teleportation]].
