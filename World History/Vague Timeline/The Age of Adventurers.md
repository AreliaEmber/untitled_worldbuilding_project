Preceded by [[The Age of Magic]]
Followed by [[The Age of Heroes]]

The age of adventurers begins with the establishment of the first international adventurers' guild in the year 247 AR (After Runes), and is generally considered to end in the year 662 AR, giving way to [[The Age of Heroes]]. 

This age is known for great discoveries of many naturally occurring magical phenomena that were previously unknown, as well as for the growing importance of adventurers in matters of state, warfare, governance, and commerce. It's also commonly referred to as an age of mercenaries or of discovery. Where human kingdoms had, before this, been relatively limited in their reach across [[Continent 1]] and [[Continent 3]], this age saw the rise of various adventurer kingdoms of varying size and notability, many of which sprang up in previously unclaimed territory thought not worth attempting to settle, or had previously only hosted small tribal peoples, including in [[Continent 2]].

Generations of adventurers lived, grew, and died in this age. While conflict certainly wasn't rare, it was a relatively peaceful age, with existing kingdoms and societies already relatively stable, and magic entrenched into society.
