Preceded by [[The Age of Ruins]]
Followed by [[The Age of Demiplanes]]

The age of prosperity began in the year 1315 AR with the completion of the restoration of [[City A]], which had been lying in rubble for 150 years until this point. While the city no longer flew, it was able to become a cultural hub relatively quickly due to it's significance in [[The Age of Hubris]]. This age ended in 1490 AR with the beginning of [[The Age of Demiplanes]].
