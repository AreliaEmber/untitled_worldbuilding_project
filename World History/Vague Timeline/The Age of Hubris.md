Followed by [[The Age of Ruins]]

The age of hubris began in the year 1106 AR when the great city [[City A]] was lifted into the sky by a series of grand [[Magic Circles]] centred around a gigantic [[Mana Crystals|Mana Crystal]]. This was the shortest age, lasting mere decades instead of centuries, ending in 1174 with the beginning of [[The Age of Ruins]].
