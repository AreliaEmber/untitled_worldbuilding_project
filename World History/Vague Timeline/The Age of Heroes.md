Preceded by [[The Age of Adventurers]]
Followed by [[The Age of Monuments]]

The age of heroes begins with the coronation of [[Character 3]] "the hero king" in 663 AR, and ends just over a hundred years later with the death of the final hero in 767 AR, giving way to [[The Age of Monuments]]. This age transition is special in that it is marked more by the end of the age of heroes than it is by the true beginning of [[The Age of Monuments]].

This is an age of great martial conflicts between tyrants and those that would fight them for nothing but the greater good. These so called "heroes" are notable for several commonly recognisable traits present in all of them:
- strong martial prowess, typically in swordsmanship
- mastery of some kind of magic, typically a kind that isn't particularly common in the region they're active in
- strong emotional bonds with their companions
- a strong sense of justice and an unwillingness to abandon any soul in need
- great deeds, often involving slaying tyrants or great beasts which were terrorizing entire regions

Because of the prevalence of heroes in this age, this is also an age where several types of great beasts began to become less and less common, with some going extinct entirely because of the numbers that were killed by heroes.
